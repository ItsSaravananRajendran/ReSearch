      "the ability to infect and replicate in monocytes / macrophages is a critically distinguishing feature between the two feline coronavirus (fcov) pathotypes : feline enteric coronavirus (fecv ; low-virulent) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv ; lethal). previously, by comparing serotype ii strains fipv 79-1146 and fecv 79-1683 and recombinant chimeric forms thereof in cultured feline bone marrow macrophages, we mapped this difference to the c-terminal part of the viral spike (s) protein (s2). in view of the later identified diagnostic difference in this very part of the s protein of serotype i fcov pathotypes, the present study aimed to further define the contribution of the earlier observed ten amino acids difference to the serotype ii virus phenotype in macrophages. using targeted rna recombination as a reverse genetics system we introduced the mutations singly and in combinations into the s gene and evaluated their effects on the infection characteristics of the mutant viruses in macrophages. while some of the single mutations had a significant effect, none of them fully reverted the infection phenotype. only by combining five specific mutations the infections mediated by the fipv and fecv spike proteins could be fully blocked or potentiated, respectively. hence, the differential macrophage infection phenotype is caused by the cooperative effect of five mutations, which occur in five functionally different domains of the spike fusion subunit s2. the significance of these observations will be discussed, taking into account also some questions related to the identity of the virus strains used.",

      "the is911 bacterial transposable element uses [UNK] 1 programmed translational frameshifting to generate the protein required for its mobility : translation initiated in one gene (orfa) shifts to the [UNK] 1 frame and continues in a second overlapping gene (orfb), thus generating the orfab transposase. the a-aaa-aag frameshift site of is911 is flanked by two stimulatory elements, an upstream shine-dalgarno sequence and a downstream stem-loop. we show here that, while they can act independently, these stimulators have a synergistic effect when combined. mutagenic analyses revealed features of the complex stem-loop that make it a low-efficiency stimulator. they also revealed the dual role of the upstream shine-dalgarno sequence as (i) a stimulator of frameshifting, by itself more potent than the stem-loop, and (ii) a mandatory determinant of initiation of orfb protein synthesis on an auu codon directly preceding the a6g motif. both roles rely on transient base pairing of the shine-dalgarno sequence with the 3 end of 16s rrna. because of its effect on frameshifting, the shine-dalgarno sequence is an important determinant of the level of transposase in is911-containing cells, and hence of the frequency of transposition.",

      "kawasaki disease (kd) is a systemic vasculitis that mostly affects children below the age of 5. the vasculitis involves arteries of medium size, especially the coronaries. various etiologies have been proposed including association with micro-organisms, bacterial superantigens, and genetic factors, however, the exact cause remains unknown. there is no specific laboratory test for kd. diagnosis is clinical and depends upon the presence of fever for ≥5 days and 4 or more of five principal features, viz. polymorphous exanthem, extremity changes, mucosal changes involving the lips and oral cavity, bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection, and unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. the term “ incomplete kd ” refers to the presence of fever and less than four principal clinical features. recognition of this group of patients is important because it is usually seen in infants and risk of coronary abnormalities is increased probably because of delays in diagnosis. however, what appears to be “ incomplete ” at a given point of time may not actually be so because some of the features may have already subsided and others may evolve over time. hence, a detailed dermatological examination is warranted in all cases, especially in incomplete kd, to ensure timely diagnosis. although kd is a self-limiting disease in most patients, coronary artery abnormalities (caas) including coronary dilatations and aneurysms may develop in up to 25 % of untreated patients. caas are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with kd. treatment is aimed at reducing inflammation and consists of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) along with aspirin. despite treatment, some patients may still develop caas, and hence, long-term follow up is of utmost importance.",

      "feline coronaviruses (fcov) comprise two biotypes : feline enteric coronaviruses (fecv) and feline infectious peritonitis viruses (fipv). fecv is associated with asymptomatic persistent enteric infections, while fipv causes feline infectious peritonitis (fip), a usually fatal systemic disease in domestic cats and some wild felidae. fipv arises from fecv by mutation. fcov also occur in two serotypes, i and ii, of which the serotype i viruses are by far the most prevalent in the field. yet, most of our knowledge about fcov infections relates to serotype ii viruses, particularly about the fipv, mainly because type i viruses grow poorly in cell culture. hence, the aim of the present work was the detailed study of the epidemiologically most relevant viruses, the avirulent serotype i viruses. kittens were inoculated oronasally with different doses of two independent fecv field strains, ucd and rm. persistent infection could be reproducibly established. the patterns of clinical symptoms, faecal virus shedding and seroconversion were monitored for up to 10 weeks revealing subtle but reproducible differences between the two viruses. faecal virus, i. e. genomic rna, was detected during persistent fecv infection only in the large intestine, downstream of the appendix, and could occasionally be observed also in the blood. the implications of our results, particularly our insights into the persistently infected state, are discussed. coronavirus / experimental infection / fecv / persistence / cat",

      "ring vaccination can be a highly effective control strategy for an emerging disease or in the final phase of disease eradication, as witnessed in the eradication of smallpox. however, the impact of behavioural dynamics on the effectiveness of ring vaccination has not been explored in mathematical models. here, we analyze a series of stochastic models of voluntary ring vaccination. contacts of an index case base vaccinating decisions on their own individual payoffs to vaccinate or not vaccinate, and they can also imitate the behaviour of other contacts of the index case. we find that including imitation changes the probability of containment through ring vaccination considerably. imitation can cause a strong majority of contacts to choose vaccination in some cases, or to choose non-vaccination in other cases-even when the equivalent solution under perfectly rational (non-imitative) behaviour yields mixed choices. moreover, imitation processes can result in very different outcomes in different stochastic realizations sampled from the same parameter distributions, by magnifying moderate tendencies toward one behaviour or the other : in some realizations, imitation causes a strong majority of contacts not to vaccinate, while in others, imitation promotes vaccination and reduces the number of secondary infections. hence, the effectiveness of ring vaccination can depend significantly and unpredictably on imitation processes. therefore, our results suggest that risk communication efforts should be initiated early in an outbreak when ring vaccination is to be applied, especially among subpopulations that are heavily influenced by peer opinions.",

      "background : haptoglobin is an acute-phase protein used as predicting diagnostic biomarker both in humans (i. e., diabetes, ovarian cancer, some neurological and cardiovascular disorders) and in animals (e. g., bovine mastitis). the latter is a frequent disease of dairy industry with staggering economical losses upon decreased milk production and increased health care costs. early stage diagnosis of the associated diseases or inflammation onset is almost impossible by conventional analytical manners. the present study demonstrates a simple, rapid, and cost-effective label-free chemiluminescence bioassay based on magnetite nanoparticles (mnps) for sensitive detection of haptoglobin by employing the specific interaction of hemoglobin-modified mnps. the resulting haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex inhibits the peroxidase-like activity of luminol / h 2 o 2-hemoglobin-mnps sensing scheme and reduces the chemiluminescence intensities correspondingly to the innate haptoglobin concentrations. quantitative detection of bovine haptoglobin was obtained within the range of 1 pg ml −1 to 1 µg ml −1, while presenting 0. 89 pg ml −1 limit of detection. moreover, the influence of causative pathogenic bacteria (i. e., streptococcus dysgalactiae and escherichia coli) and somatic cell counts (depicting healthy, sub-clinical and clinical mastitis) on the emitted chemiluminescence radiation were established. the presented bioassay quantitative performances correspond with a standardized assay kit in differentiating dissimilar milk qualities. overall, the main advantage of the presented sensing concept is the ability to detect haptoglobin, at clinically relevant concentrations within real milk samples for early bio-diagnostic detection of mastitis and hence adjusting the precise treatment, potentially initiating a positive influence on animals ' individual health and hence on dairy farms economy.",
