      "an outbreak of a novel coronavirus, now formally named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars ‐ cov ‐ 2) and causing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid ‐ 19), emerged in the city of wuhan in hubei province in central china in december 2019. the first cases were noted as a cluster of patients with pneumonia who were all linked to a live animal market, and testing found the presence of a previously unknown coronavirus. coronaviruses are a group of viruses that affect both animals and humans, and several (oc43,229e, hku1 and nl63) are a cause of the common cold. 1,2 however, two coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more severe disease : the sars coronavirus in 2002 – 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012. 1,2 chinese authorities and researchers should be commended for their rapid sharing of viral sequences which enabled laboratories worldwide to develop diagnostic tests within weeks of discovery of the pathogen. 3 an australian laboratory subsequently isolated the virus from a clinical sample (the first to do so outside of china), and rapidly shared this virus with relevant global agencies, further aiding diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine development efforts. information on the new virus and its impact is being updated constantly. we know that sars ‐ cov ‐ 2 can cause severe disease, although active surveillance of contacts is required to define the milder end of the disease spectrum and to estimate the true hospitalisation and case fatality ratio. the cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults ; it is currently unclear whether comorbidities reflect the age group affected or whether they are risk factors for severe disease. 4,5 early studies using data before the institution of public health interventions in china suggest that sars ‐ cov ‐ 2 is as transmissible as sars coronavirus and probably more transmissible than influenza viruses. 6,7 the timing of infectiousness relative to symptom onset is a particularly important parameter with implications for public health control. while reports suggest that asymptomatic infection and transmission may result from minimally symptomatic cases, the contribution of this to transmission is not yet known. 8 careful analysis of early data suggests that the mean incubation period is 6 days, with a range of up to 14 days. 9 reports of large outbreaks, particularly associated with hospitals and closed communities, raise the possibility of “ superspreading ” events, a feature of previous coronavirus outbreaks. 10 the importance of infection control is also reinforced by a report that 41 % of cases in wuhan were acquired nosocomially (including 40 health care workers and 17 patients). 4 as at 26 february 2020, there were 23 confirmed cases of covid ‐ 19 in australia, across five jurisdictions. although reported case numbers in china are slowing, large outbreaks on a cruise ship in japan, and in south korea, iran and italy are concerning and highlight our interconnected world. however, it is likely that this will change in the days or weeks ahead. although absolute case numbers are small in australia, the public health, political and societal ramifications have already been considerable, ranging from travel restrictions on non ‐ australians coming from china, the use of offshore and remote quarantine facilities, and disturbing reports of racism against members of our asian community (https : / / insightplus. mja. com. au / 2020 / 5 / coronavirus-no-place-for-racism-xenophobia /).",

      "the outbreak of a new coronavirus (sars-cov-2) disease has become pandemic. to be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95 % of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. at the moment, the who-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~ 100, respectively), however, over 80 % of adult-and 95 % of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal. we compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 chinese provinces. this cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of covid-19 disease with both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. the full range of incubation periods of the covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. there were 6 (0. 13 %) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25. 5 years and 2 males with a median age of 36 years. the median incubation period of both male and female adults was similar (7-day) but significantly shorter than that (9-day) of child cases (p = 0. 02). this cohort contained 4 transmission generations, and incubation periods of the cases between generations were not significantly different, suggesting that the virus has not been rapidly adapted to human beings. interestingly, incubation periods of 233 cases (11. 6 %) were longer than the who-established quarantine period (14 days). data modeling suggested that if adults take an extra 4-day or 7-day of isolation (i. e., a quarantine period of 18 or 21 days), 96. 2 % or 98. 3 %, respectively, of the people who are developing symptoms will be more effectively quarantined. patients transmitted via lunch / dinner parties (i. e., gastrointestinal tract infection. cc-by-nc 4. 0 international license it is made available under a author / funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed) the copyright holder for this preprint.",

      "coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), emerged in wuhan, china in the end of 2019, and soon spread oversea. a comprehensive and timely review summarized the scientific research in estimating the basic reproduction number (r0) released from 1 january to 7 february 2020 [ 1 ]. during the early outbreak, when the key epidemiological features of covid-19 were uncovered, the r0 estimation largely relied on the growth rate of the epidemic curve and the estimation of the serial interval (si). here, we demonstrated that an overlarge si would lead to overestimation of r0. we adopted the growing process proposed in [ 2 ] deterministically with a population of 11 million in wuhan, 1 case initially onset on 5 december 2019 and a fixed step at 1 day. we consider two values of the mean serial interval (si) that are si at 4. 6 days estimated based on 28 records of transmission chains [ 3 ], which was largely consistent with the si estimate at 4. 4 days based on 71 records [ 4 ] ; and si at 8 days, which was closer to the si of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars, 8. 4 days), si of the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers, 7. 6 days). as for demonstration that a larger si could lead to overestimation in r0, we conducted the simulation with two schemes that are scheme (i) : r0 = 2, and si = 4. 6 days ; and scheme (ii) : r0 = 2,3,4 and 3. 3 as summarized in [ 1 ], and si = 8 days. we also compared the simulation results with the previous estimates of the cumulative number of covid-19 infection in wuhan. in fig 1, the simulation results of the scheme (i) had almost the same growing trends as those of scheme (ii) with r0 = 3. 3. although a higher r0 could force the epidemic curve increasing rapidly, a shorter si could increase iteration of transmission generation, i. e., transmission may occur shortly post infection. according to the simple approximated formula that r0 = exp ([UNK]), where γ was the exponential growth rate calculated from the incidence data directly, a longer si would lead to a higher r0 estimate theoretically. with a shorter si at 4. 6 days, which was supported by richer datasets in [ 3,4 ], the r0 of covid-19 could be lower than previous estimates based on longer si. by using the growth rate (γ) at 0. 15 per day, the r0 was found at 2. 0 with si at 4. 6 days, whereas 3. 3 with si at 8 days. although the effects of public health control were ignored in this analysis, our model could be downloaded from https : / / academic. oup. com / jtm / advance-article-abstract / doi / 10. 1093 / jtm / taaa033 / 5803291 by guest on 13 march 2020 4 extended by introducing an effective reproduction number accounting for the effectiveness of the control measures, and we remarked this modification would not affect the main conclusion. furthermore, as pointed out in [ 3 ], provided that the si of covid-19 might be shorter than its incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur shortly after being infected [ 5 ]. this implies that a fraction of transmissions cannot be prevented solely through isolating the symptomatic cases, since the time when contact tracing is conducted, they may have already been infectious and generated secondary cases. therefore, the effectively quarantine of suspected (and probable) cases, as well as close contacts, and timely contact tracing were crucial in successful outbreak mitigation.",
